**Introduction**  
This project aims to develop a banana ripeness detection system based on deep learning for sensor networks. Through this system, users can quickly and accurately judge the ripeness of bananas, which is divided into three stages: Underripe, Ripe, and Overripe. This system is trained on the Edge Impulse platform and uses a large amount of banana image data from different maturity stages to ensure the accuracy of the model. This model is deployed on the mobile phone and implements a portable and practical banana ripeness detection tool.  

The inspiration comes from a common problem in daily life: how to accurately determine the ripeness of fruits. Most people judge whether fruits are ripe by observing their appearance, color, hardness, or smell, which is not only time-consuming and laborious but also has limited accuracy. Accurate judgment of maturity is particularly important, especially for fruits like bananas that are prone to spoilage.  

Adhi Harmoko Saputro(2018) states that the change in the banana's skin color from green to yellow, which signals the banana's maturity, is due to the breakdown of chlorophyll pigment. The real-time classification of bananas using an image processing tool in MATLAB, which employs the RGB color detection technique, is a non-destructive, quick, reliable, and effective process for categorizing bananas (Maithilee Nagesh Kulkarni and Rohini Mudhalwadkar, 2017). A simple algorithm using the CNN model is proposed to determine the ripeness color of fruit, specifically bananas, which can enhance the efficiency for cashiers and customers at counters by simplifying the process of determining fruit and vegetable prices, potentially replacing the conventional weighing method and saving time(Priyanka et al., n.d., 2020).
